Description: Performs Bayesian hypothesis tests of designs where cell
        means or cell-mean-like quantities are estimated. It also works
        for designs where it is not cell means themselves that are
        estimated, but differences from a grand mean or intercept. It
        includes functions for testing main effects and interactions. It
        can used with nested and unbalanced designs, with a little
        effort.
